TODO: Needs update. -Robin

- Make sure BroV6 works.

- Make sure --enable-int64 builds w/o warnings.

- Update TODO-For-Next-Release.

- Build distribution on a system with an up-to-date yacc (MacOS suffices).

- make distcheck

- Edit CHANGES to final version.

- Fix VERSION to final value.

- Update version info (and perhaps other stuff) in README.

- Check everything in.

- Make an SVN branch for the release:

    svn cp svn+ssh://svn.icir.org/bro/trunk \
	    svn+ssh://svn.icir.org/bro/releases/release_1_X

- scp bro-XXX.tar.gz crd.lbl.gov:/ftp/BROIDS/
  scp CHANGES crd.lbl.gov:/ftp/BROIDS/bro-change-log.txt

- Fix symlinks on crd:

	bro-1.X-release.tar.gz
	bro-1.X-current.tar.gz
	bro-1.<n>-release.tar.gz

- Update crd:/www/BROIDS/download.html to reflect new version.  This page
  is generated from trunk/bro-web/download.xml.  Edit this file, and also
  update the (web page) version in build.xml, the copyright year in
  navigation.xml, and create a news entry in news.xml.

  Type 'ant style' on a machine with 'ant' installed, and copy
  html/*.html to crd.lbl.gov:/www/BROIDS/ .

- Send email to bro@bro-ids.org.  Look for "release now available" in
  previous messages as a template.
